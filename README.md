# ALS-Disease-K-Means-Clustering-for-different-phenotypes-using-Python
Performing KMeans clustering for selected phenotypes out of 100 possible phenotypes. 
The ALSFRS_slope component is to be predicted using few phenotypes and therefore will be held as constant Y-axis. ALl other variables well be plotted against'ALSFRS_slope' and inference will be used to select few variables.
